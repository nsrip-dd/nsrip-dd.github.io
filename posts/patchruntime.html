<p>
Every now and then,
I've run into a tricky Go bug that seems to involve the compiler, runtime, or standard library.
Try as I might, I can't reproduce the bug.
I've only seen it happen in production.
I don't have enough information to diagnose the issue.
Sometimes I've wished I could get the runtime to emit some more diagnostics,
or just wanted to try out a potential fix from another Go contributor.
This post covers a few ways you can build your Go programs with changes applied to the compiler, runtime, or standard library.
</p>

<p>
The short version:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The most flexible option is to build a toolchain distribution from (modified) source.
You'll need to do this if you're changing the compiler, linker, or other tools.
</li>
<li>
If you're only modifying the runtime or standard library,
use <a href="https://github.com/felixge/go-patch-overlay" target="_blank"><code>go-patch-overlay</code></a>
to apply patches at build time.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="hover">
<h2 id="toolchain">Build a toolchain from source <a href="#toolchain" class="hide">&sect;</a></h2>
</div>

<p>
The first method is to build a custom Go toolchain,
and use it to build your program.
By toolchain, I mean the collection of tools (<code>go</code> command, compiler, linker, etc),
along with the runtime and standard library sources.
There are ways to change the runtime and standard library sources when you build your program.
But if you want to change the tools,
you'll need to build them ahead of time.
</p>

<p>
You first check out the Go source code:
</p>

<pre>git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go</pre>

<p>
If you're making a change to a specific Go release version,
use <code>git switch --detach {release tag}</code> to check it out.
Then you make the changes you want.
</p>

<p>
If you want to build the toolchain to use locally,
there's a script to build it:
</p>

<pre>cd src
./make.bash
</pre>

<p>
Then add <code>/path/to/go/bin</code> to your <code>PATH</code>.
After that, running the <code>go</code> command will use the toolchain you built.
</p>

<p>
What if you want to give this toolchain to someone else,
or use it in your CI?
My colleague <a href="https://github.com/gandem" target="_blank">Nayef</a> has done this at Datadog.
Here's how he's done it:
</p>

<p>
You'll need a <code>VERSION</code> file to make a distribution:
</p>

<pre>echo go1.x.y > VERSION</pre>

<p>
Replace <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with numbers.
For example,
if you were testing a fix for <code>go1.24.4</code>,
you could do <code>go1.24.999</code>.
That'll give you a valid version that's also unlikely to collide with a real Go version.
</p>

<p>
Then you'll actually build the distribution:
</p>

<pre>cd src/
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 ./make.bash -distpack 
</pre>

<p>
Set <code>GOOS</code> and <code>GOARCH</code> as needed.
You'll end up with a distribution like
</p>

<pre>
../pkg/distpack/go1.X.Y.linux-amd64.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>
To actually <i>use</i> this,
you'll essentially follow the steps in the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install" target="_blank">Go installation docs</a>.
Copy <code>go1.X.Y.linux-amd64.tar.gz</code> to wherever you want to install it,
and then extract it.
You'll need to update the <code>PATH</code> environment variable
to include the <code>bin</code> subdirectory of the resulting directory.
Then when you run the <code>go</code> command you'll be using the custom toolchain.

</p>

<h2 id="gotip">Use the <code>gotip</code> tool <a href="#gotip" class="hide">&sect;</a></h2>
</div>

<p>
If you have a CL you'd like to use (from <a href="https://go.dev/cl" target="_blank">go.dev/cl</a>),
there's a tool that can build the toolchain for you.
It's called <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/dl/gotip" target="_blank"><code>gotip</code></a>.
This might apply to you if you've reported a bug,
and a Go maintainer has a potential fix for you to try.
The <code>gotip</code> readme explains it,
but here's a concrete example:
</p>

<p>
Say you want to try out <a href="https://go.dev/cl/12345" target="_blank">go.dev/cl/12345</a>.
The "CL number" is 12345.
You can then use <code>gotip</code> like so:
</p>

<pre>go install golang.org/dl/gotip@latest
gotip download 12345
</pre>

<p>
This will download the Go sources from that CL number,
and then build the Go toolchain from those sources.
Then you can use <code>gotip</code> to build your program in place of the normal <code>go</code> command.
</p>

<div class="hover">
<h2 id="bazel">Bazel <a href="#bazel" class="hide">&sect;</a></h2>
</div>

<p>
If you build your Go code with Bazel,
then ignore the rest of this post and just refer to this section.
Full disclosure:
At the time of writing this post,
I haven't actually used this method.
I don't know if this works for compiler/linker/etc patches or just runtime/library code.
But we have some Bazel stuff at Datadog so it seemed worth mentioning here.
The <code>rules_go</code> rules support patching the tools and libraries out of the box.
It's described <a href="https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_go/blob/master/go/toolchains.rst#go_download_sdk" target="_blank">here</a>.
Here's an example straight from the manual:
</p>

<pre>
go_download_sdk(
    name = "go_sdk",
    goos = "linux",
    goarch = "amd64",
    version = "1.18.1",
    sdks = {
        "linux_amd64": ("go1.18.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz", "b3b815f47ababac13810fc6021eb73d65478e0b2db4b09d348eefad9581a2334"),
        "darwin_amd64": ("go1.18.1.darwin-amd64.tar.gz", "3703e9a0db1000f18c0c7b524f3d378aac71219b4715a6a4c5683eb639f41a4d"),
    },
    <b>patch_strip = 1,
    patches = [
        "//patches:cgo_issue_fix.patch",
    ]</b>
)
</pre>

<p>
I've bolded the relevant part.
You just provide a list of patches,
and they're applied when Bazel builds and installs the toolchain.
</p>

<div class="hover">
<h2 id="patch">Patch the sources from the toolchain <a href="#patch" class="hide">&sect;</a></h2>
</div>

<p>
As mentioned previously,
if you want to change the compiler, linker, or other tools,
you'll need to rebuild them.
But if your changes are just to the runtime or standard library,
you have other options.
Your Go toolchain includes the runtime and standard library source code.
The code for your toolchain is under the toolchain's <code>GOROOT</code>:
</p>

<pre>
% go env GOROOT
/usr/local/go
% go1.24.4 env GOROOT
/Users/nick/sdk/go1.24.4
</pre>

<p>
There are a few ways you can modify the source code.
The first way is to edit it directly.
You can use a text editor,
or if you have a patch, you can apply it to the source code.
<b>Don't do this to your local toolchain installation!</b>
It's a pain to undo your changes.
This method is suitable for doing during a build in a Docker container.
</p>

<p>
There are a few ways to get a patch:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Somebody gives you one</li>
<li>You check out the Go sources and edit them. Then run <code>git diff > change.patch</code></li>
<li>
You get one from a CL.
You can visit the CL page, where there should be a link to download the change as a patch.
Or you can download the patch via the <a href="https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.12.0/rest-api-changes.html#get-patch" target="_blank">API</a>
<pre>
CL_NUMBER=12345
curl -XGET "https://go-review.googlesource.com/changes/go~${CL_NUMBER}/revisions/current/patch?raw" > ${CL_NUMBER}.patch
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Assuming you have a patch,
you can apply it to the Go toolchain sources like so:
</p>

<pre>
pushd $(go env GOROOT)
git apply /path/to/patch1.diff /path/to/patch2.diff ...
popd
go build ...
</pre>

<p>
Whatever changes you make to the sources will be reflected in the program you build.
Expect your build to be a bit slower if you change widely depended-upon packages,
like <code>runtime</code>.
</p>

<div class="hover">
<h2 id="overlay">Build-time overlay <a href="#overlay" class="hide">&sect;</a></h2>
</div>

<p>
Turns out there's another way to change the Go sources at build time,
without needing to actually modify your installation.
The <code>go build</code> command accepts an <code>-overlay</code> argument.
The argument is a path to a JSON file like this:
</p>

<pre>
{
  "Replace": {
    "/path/to/source1.go": "/other/path/to/replacement.go",
    "/path/to/source2.go": "",
    ...
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Basically, an <i>overlay</i> is a key-value map where the keys are file paths seen by the compiler,
and the values are replacement files.
This can even include new or deleted files.
The overlay feature was <a href="https://go.dev/cl/253747" target="_blank">originally added</a> to support <code>gopls</code>,
where the language server needs to tell the compiler about files whose contents haven't been written to disk.
We can use it to try out patches.
</p>

<p>
There's a tool that can generate an overlay for you from patches:
<a href="https://github.com/felixge/go-patch-overlay" target="_blank"><code>go-patch-overlay</code></a>.
My colleague Felix wrote this a few years ago.
I wrote a very similar program during a recent team research week with a few fixes and extra features,
before I knew about Felix's program,
so we incorporated my changes into his program.
You use the tool like this:
</p>

<pre>
go install github.com/felixge/go-patch-overlay@main
go build -overlay=$(go-patch-overlay /path/to/patch.diff)
</pre>

<p>
It works like this:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The <code>go-patch-overlay</code> command reads the patch and determines which files it modifies.
</li>
<li>
Then the tool runs <code>go env GOROOT</code> to find where the toolchain sources are installed.
It copies any modified files into a new temporary directory.
</li>
<li>
Then the tool applies the patch to the sources it copied from the toolchain <code>GOROOT</code>.
</li>
<li>
Then the tool creates an overlay JSON file mapping the original sources to the modified sources.
The tool then prints the path to the JSON file to standard out.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The file replacements in the overlay only apply to that specific <code>go build</code> invocation.
Your toolchain's sources are unchanged.
You can also pass the <code>-overlay</code> argument to <code>go run</code> and <code>go test</code>.
</p>

<p>
I personally like this method the best for runtime/standard library changes.
It's lightweight,
non-destructive,
and easy to use both locally and in CI.

</div>

<p>
There's one more tool worth mentioning here:
<a href="https://github.com/datadog/orchestrion" target="_blank">Orchestrion</a>.
Orchestrion automatically instruments Go code.
It was originally built for distributed tracing, profiling, and security monitoring instrumentation.
It works by rewriting source code at build time.
It's a really powerful tool,
kind of a low orbit ion cannon compared to the hammer of applying a patch.
I won't go into the details here.
If the changes you want to make are simple,
I'd start with patches and <code>go-patch-overlay</code>.
But keep Orchestrion in mind if you need something more powerful.
