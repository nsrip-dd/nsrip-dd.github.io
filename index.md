I'm Nick Ripley, and this is my blog.

I work for Datadog on the Continuous Profiler product.
I'm a maintainer of Datadog's Go profiler library.
As part of my work, I've contributed improvements and fixes to the Go runtime.
I helped build Datadog's [Profiling Timeline](https://blog.felixge.de/debug-go-request-latency-with-datadogs-profiling-timeline/) view,
writing the backend code to process Go execution traces for visualization,
implementing the data collection in the client library,
and contributing to the visualization.

For fun I like to play instruments (mainly guitar and bass).
I also enjoy video games, cooking, and bouldering.
